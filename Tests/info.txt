4,5-DUMMY FOLDERS; NOT MONITORED BY GIT

Conserv-Folder contains test cases when conservative formulation of conduction is used (Planar)

ConstPropForm-contains all first test cases when constant properties formulation was used; 
	also when changing properties based on eta was implemented WITHOUT changing the conduction formulation (Planar)
	Folders: A0, ChangingProp, dH, Eign, Flux, Mesh, Non-nt, NoSource, Tign

Axisymmetric-Folder containing cases for axisymmetric runs (still conservative formulation)

All_Data.xlsx-spreadsheet containing all data collected from every test run
