# 2D Heat Conduction Code

This repository contains the Python code to solve the 2D Heat conduction equations.

# Current state:
-solve 2D heat conduction with no source terms (Explicit or implicit)
-Combustion source term from Kim (Explicit only)
-can be run from command prompt

# To run code from cmd:
cd [directory]
python main.py [input file name] [Output directory]

[input file name]-name of input file; must be txt file; do NOT include extension in name
[Output directory]-directory to save data files to; based on current directory; will create if non-existent
